# End-to-End Machine learning practice


The task we are performing here is to build a model using the California census data inorder to predict housing prices.
The housing.csv dataset has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We can call each blocks as districts.
Our machine learning model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district
